::Objective::: **WHAT** is to be achieved, no more and no less
::Key Results::: benchmark and monitor **HOW** we get to the objective

**Types of Objectives**
- *Commitments* are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they are delivered
- *Aspirational OKRs* express how weâ€™d like the world to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or the resources necessary to deliver the OKR

**Effective Key Results are**
- specific
- time-bound
- aggressive yet realistic
- measurable
- verifiable

::Retrospective::
*Googles Score System*
- 0.7 to 1.0 = green. (We delivered.)
- 0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress, but fell short of completion.)
- 0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress.)
